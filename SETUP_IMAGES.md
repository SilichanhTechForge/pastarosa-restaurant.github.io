# 🖼️ IMAGE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## Quick Setup for Pasta Rosa Website

### Step 1: Place Your Image
1. **Find your `1.jpeg` image file** (your restaurant/food photo)
2. **Copy it** to this folder: `assets/images/`
3. **Make sure the filename is exactly: `1.jpeg`**

Your folder structure should look like this:
```
Pasta Rosa Restaurant/
├── assets/
│   └── images/
│       └── 1.jpeg  ← Place your image here
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
└── ... other files
```

### Step 2: View the Website
1. Open VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select **"Open with Live Server"** (if you have the extension installed)
4. Or manually open: `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Result
The hero section on the home page will now display your `1.jpeg` image as the background with a semi-transparent overlay for text readability.

## Optional: Add More Images

The website also references these images (optional):
- `assets/images/food/professional-plating-1.jpeg` - Featured pasta on home page
- `assets/images/food/dessert-tiramisu.jpeg` - Tiramisu image
- `assets/images/food/dessert-panna-cotta.jpeg` - Panna Cotta image
- `assets/images/food/dessert-souffle.jpeg` - Soufflé image
- `assets/images/pasta-1.jpg` - Gallery photos
- `assets/images/dining-1.jpg` - Restaurant ambiance
- etc.

You can create these subdirectories and add images as you get them. The website will work fine with just the `1.jpeg` for now!

## Need Help?

If the image doesn't show:
1. Make sure the filename is exactly `1.jpeg` (case-sensitive on some systems)
2. Verify it's in the `assets/images/` folder
3. Refresh the browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
4. Check the browser's Developer Console (F12) for errors
